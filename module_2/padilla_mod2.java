CSD320 Module 2 Assignment

Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperature of the water.
The formula to use for this program is:
Q = waterMass ( finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature ) x 4184
waterMass is water weight in kilograms
finalTemperature and initialTemperature are temperatures in Celsius
Q is the results in Joules
