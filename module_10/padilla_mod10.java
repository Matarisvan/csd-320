CSD320 Module 10 Assignment

Write four overloaded methods that return the average of an array with the following headers:

public static short average(short [] array)
public static int average(int [] array)
public static long average(long [] array)
public static double average(double [] array)

Write a test program that invokes each of these methods and then displays the average value returned along with a display of the original array elements.
Ensure the display is easy to read and understandable.
Lastly, each array sent into the methods must be of different sizes to ensure the method code is correctly written.
